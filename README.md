# Summer-Internship-Project-DMRC
Contains the project "Automated Threat Intelligence Pipeline for Firewall Security" which was done by me in summer internship second year at Delhi Metro Rail Corporation.

• Built an automated system to extract, parse, validate, and integrate cyber threat intelligence (IoCs) directly from
email advisories into firewall blocklists.
• Parsed structured and unstructured emails to extract IoCs such as IPs, Domains, URLs, and File Hashes.
• Integrated with firewall via APIs to continuously update threat signatures without manual effort.
• Developed a GUI dashboard for IOC handling, monitoring, audit logs, and exception management.
• Added automated email reporting, data retention & cleanup, and credential encryption for secure operation.
